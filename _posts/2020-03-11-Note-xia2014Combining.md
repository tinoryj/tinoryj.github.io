## Summary

### Strength

* Theoretical analysis of the cost of each part in system.
* Simple but very effective idea, which makes use of the locality of the chunks and achieve better results than DARE.
* Complete experiments, experimental comparison of each modules' algorithm selection.

### Weekness

* This solution can only be used for the current input data stream, and cannot do deduplication and compression with existing data (Limited effect on long / large data writes).
* For large files, there is a problem that the memory overhead is too large or cannot be used (only the maximum 3GB file was tested in the experiment).
