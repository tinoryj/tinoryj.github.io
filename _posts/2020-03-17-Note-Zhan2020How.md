## What

A flexible cloning (logic copy) in BetrFS which is an open source, full path indexing and write-optimized file system.

## Why

* The two copy method:
    * **Physical Copy**: High Latency; High space useage.
    * **Logic Copy (Copy on write)**: Low latency; Better space usage; *High Fragmentation*.
* Existing logic copy implementations like BTRFS/XFS/ZFS have large space amplification of high fragmentation.
* Space-Locality tradeoff in inode file system:
    * Larger blocks have better locality, but have worse space efficiency;
    * Smaller blocks have worse locality, but have better space efficiency;

* **Main Problem: How to achieve space efficient / low latency / fast read / fast write in file system copy operation?**

## How

* Use $B^{\sigma}$-DAGs (directed acyclic graph) to take place of $B^{\sigma}$-Trees in BertFS.
* $B^{\sigma}$-DAGs could share data between files.
* Logical copy by adding edge to the DAGs, and pivots include a prefix translations.
* Copy-on-Abundant-Write: when flush changes, copy-on-write and abundant unreachable data, and move pivot translation.
* Reducing copy latency by flush multi-level at once (cover the subtree), and set a `GOTO` message for direct link. When `GOTO` flushed to target+1 level, change `GOTO` to a real pivot.


## Some Details

### BetrFS original features:

* $B^{\sigma}$-tree: write optimized key-value store like LSM tree, each flush of it applies many small changes.
* Range operations.
* Full-path indexing and renaming.

## Summary

### Strength

* A sample data structure modify on BertFS makes copy fast and cheap while reduce the latency by a new message in file system is very interesting.
* Complete and realistic experiments include git / tar / rsync / IMAP.

### Weakness

* The metadata storage space overhead is not measured in evaluation.
