## What

This paper proposes a write-optimized and high-performance hashing index scheme, called **level hashing** to efficiently index the data in persistent memory.

## Why

Due to the requirement of data consistency and hardware limitations of Non-volatile memory (NVM), traditional indexing techniques originally designed for DRAM become inefficient in persistent memory. 

* Challenges of hashing indexes for PM
    * High overhead for consistency guarantee
    * Performance degradation for reducing writes
    * Cost inefficiency for resizing hash table (rehash all items when resizing)



## How

### Write-optimized & High-performance Hash Table Structure

* Multiple slots per bucket 
* Two hash locations for each key
* Sharing-based two-level structure
    * Top-level is addressable by hash functions, the Bottom-level ia not addressable and used to provide standby positions for Top-level (store conflicting buckets).
* At most one movement for each successful insertion
    * Perform a one-step insert search on two levels, and resizing if it cannot be inserted.

### Cost-efficient In-place Resizing Scheme

* Insert a new Top-level on old Top-level (Double the hash table size)
* Rehash old Bottom-level and insert the item to the new Top-level (At most 1/3 data need rehash)

### Low-overhead Consistency Guarantee Scheme

* Log free: Use a token associated with each slot in the openaddressing hash tables 
    * Indicate whether the slot is empty 
    * A token is 1 bit, e.g., “1” for non-empty, “0” for empty
    * Modifying the token area only needs an atomic write(log-free operations)
* Log free update:
    * Check whether there is an empty slot in the bucket storing the old item

## Summary

### Strength

* Simple and exquisite multi-layer hash design solves the problem of hash index in persistent memory.
* Simple use of bitmap to achieve consistency without logging.

### Weekness

* It is still a persistent memory experiment based on DRAM simulation, and it is impossible to determine whether the effect on the actual persistent memory is consistent with the simulation.
